Q.1  What is Node.js? How does it differ from browser JavaScript?
->  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, mainly on the server side.
It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and is commonly used to build backend services, APIs, real-time apps, and CLI tools.
    Difference Between Node.js & Browser JavaScript:
